# ðŸ“‚ GitHub Clone Directory â€” `ghcd`

> A CLI to _clone_[^1] a subdirectory of a GitHub repository

```sh
npx ghcd@latest [options] <url> <dir>
```

## Usage

Open the subdirectory you want to clone in GitHub, and copy the URL. Then run:

```sh
npx ghcd@latest https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app
```

This will download `create-next-app` directory of the `vercel/next.js` repository into a new folder.

The `https://github.com/` part is optional, so you can also run:

```sh
npx ghcd@latest vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app
```

### Specifying the output directory

You can specify the output directory by passing directory name as the second argument:

```sh
npx ghcd@latest vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app my-copy-of-create-next-app
```

## Options

### `--init` / `-i`

Initialize a new git repository in the downloaded directory.

[^1]: The term _clone_ is used loosely here. ðŸ«£ The CLI does not actually clone the repository, but rather downloads the files into a new folder.

### `--help` / `-h`

Show help.
